      <section>
        <h2> About Aaron</h2>
        <p>I began my journey to become a software developer in 2020 thanks to the help from the people at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I was allowed to pursue a career in tech. Now I am looking forward to a future where I can work with others who share the same passion as I do and learn from them as well.</p>
        
        <p>Other than coding you can always find me working on music or creating clothes. I run a small clothing brand and make music as a hobby and plan to use my web developer skills to promote both. </p>
